However, the API is very complex to understand. This is the reason why Telethon (https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) is used. This library allows to interact with the Telegram API on a more abstract level.\n\nThe receiver of the message will see the phone number that was used during the authorization process.\n\n0. Execute Account Linking:\n    Use account from above or newly created account\n1. Go to TextNow (https://www.textnow.com/login) and login:\n    User: alexatesting\n    Password: testforamazon\n2. Download Telegram Desktop (https://desktop.telegram.org/) and login.\n    Phone number: +19062121566\n    Code: Check TextNow for a text message from Telegram with a 5 digit code.\n3. Execute the authorization process:\n    1.: Go to: bit.ly/my-telegrams and login. Enter your telephone number (+19062121566).\n    2.: USER: \"Alexa, start My Telegrams\"\n        ALEXA: \"Welcome...

Say code to Alexa.\n    Note: watch out: You should authorize yourself within the first 4 codes that you get in Telegram\n    otherwise you will be blocked for 24 hours by Telegram\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTest the skill:\n1. Test: Sending a Telegram\n    \"Alexa, ask My Telegrams to send a Telegram.\"\n    \"Alexa, ask My Telegrams to send a telegram to Lorenz.\"\n\n2. Test: Listening to Messages:\n    \"Alexa, ask My Telegrams to check my Telegrams.\"\n\n3. Test: Speed Dial Feature\n    Go to: bit.ly/my-telegrams and login.\n    Create a speed dial contact.\n    First Name: Lorenz\n    Number: 25\n    \"Alexa, ask My Telegrams to make a speed dial\"\n    \"Alexa, ask My Telegrams to make a speed dial to 25\"\n\nYou can also check following youtube video:\nbit.ly/my-telegrams-video",
